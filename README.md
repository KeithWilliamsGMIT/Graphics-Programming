# Graphics-Programming
Work from my 3rd year graphics programming module in college. This was a semester long module in which we covered a variety of topics.

#### Topics covered
1. HTML5 canvas

The HTML5 canvas was used in labs one to six as an introduction to graphics programming. It was used to study trigonometry, physics and user interaction.
2. SVG

In lab 7, SVG tags were used to demonstrate vector graphics.
3. D3.js

In lab 8 I used D3.js to create a chart to compare the value of the GBP to the EURO over time. The data for this chart was downloaded as a JSON file from a server. The user can zoom in and out from the chart.
4. Three.js

Three.js was used in lab 9 as an introduction to 3D graphics programming. It demonstrates 3D objects, materials, lights, cameras and shadows.
